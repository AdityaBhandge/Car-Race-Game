Speed Rush: Extreme Highway

A 3D-like car racing and passing game prototype built with Pygame.

Files:
- speed_rush.py  - main game script
- assets/        - put images, sounds and fonts here

Required Python packages:
- pygame

Quick start:
1. Create an `assets/` folder next to `speed_rush.py`.
2. Place images and sounds described in `assets/README_assets.txt` into it.
3. Install pygame: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run: `python speed_rush.py`.

If any asset is missing, the game falls back to simple shapes and silent sounds so it will still run.

Enjoy! :)
